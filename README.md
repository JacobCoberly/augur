## What is Augur?

Augur is a software suite for collecting and measuring structured data
about [free](https://www.fsf.org/about/) and [open-source](https://opensource.org/docs/osd) software (FOSS) communities.

Augur’s main focus is to measure the overall health and sustainability of open source projects, as these types of projects are system critical for nearly every software organization or company. We do this by gathering data about project repositories and normalizing that into our data model to provide useful metrics about your project’s health. For example, one of our metrics is Burstiness. Burstiness – how are short timeframes of intense activity, followed by a corresponding return to a typical pattern of activity, observed in a project?

This can paint a picture of a project’s focus and gain insight into the potential stability of a project and how its typical cycle of updates occurs. 

We are a [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community) project, and many of our
metrics are implementations of the metrics defined by our awesome community. You can find a full list of them [here](https://chaoss.community/metrics/).

## Collecting Data

Augur collects more data about open source software projects than any other available software. Augur's main focus is to measure the overall health and sustainability of open source projects.
One of Augur's core tenets is a desire to openly gather data that people can trust, and then provide useful and well-defined metrics that help give important context to the larger stories being told by that data. We do this in a variety of ways, one of which is doing all our own data collection in house. We currently collect data from a few main sources:

1. Raw Git commit logs (commits, contributors)
2. GitHub's API (issues, pull requests, contributors, releases, repository metadata)
3. The Linux Foundation's [Core Infrastructure Initiative](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/) API (repository metadata)
4. [Succinct Code Counter](https://github.com/boyter/scc), a blazingly fast Sloc, Cloc, and Code tool that also performs COCOMO calculations

This data is collected by dedicated data collection workers controlled by Augur, each of which is responsible for querying some subset of these data sources. We are also hard at work building workers for new data sources. If you have an idea for a new one, [please tell us](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) - we'd love your input!


## Getting Started

If you're interested in collecting data with our tool, the Augur team has worked hard to develop a detailed guide to get started with our project which can be found [in our documentation](https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/main/getting-started/toc.html).

If you're looking to contribute to Augur's code, you can find installation instructions, development guides, architecture references (coming soon), best practices and more in our [developer documentation](https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/main/development-guide/toc.html). Please know that while it's still rather sparse right now,
but we are actively adding to it all the time. If you get stuck, please feel free to [ask for help](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/issues/new)!

## Contributing

To contribute to Augur, please follow the guidelines found in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Augur is a welcoming community that is open to all, regardless if you're working on your 1000th contribution to open source or your 1st. We strongly believe that much of what makes open source so great is the incredible communities it brings together, so we invite you to join us!
